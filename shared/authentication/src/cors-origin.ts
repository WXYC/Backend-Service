/**
 * Resolve the Express-level `cors` middleware `origin` option from env
 * configuration — fail closed instead of open (BS#1107).
 *
 * Both apps used to configure `origin: process.env.FRONTEND_SOURCE || '*'`
 * next to `credentials: true`. With the `cors` package, `'*'` + credentials
 * reflects the request's `Origin` header back as
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and emits
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`, so any web origin could make
 * credentialed (cookie-bearing) requests whenever `FRONTEND_SOURCE` was
 * forgotten in a deploy. This helper removes the wildcard fallback entirely.
 *
 * Lives in its own file so the helper is testable without instantiating
 * `betterAuth({...})` — same rationale as `oidc-login-page.ts` and
 * `oidc-trusted-clients.ts`.
 *
 * Env contract:
 *   - `envVarNames` are consulted in order; the first var with a non-empty
 *     value wins. The backend passes the default (`FRONTEND_SOURCE` only);
 *     the auth service additionally falls back to
 *     `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` so a deploy that configures better-auth's
 *     trusted origins but not `FRONTEND_SOURCE` keeps serving its login flow
 *     instead of failing closed.
 *   - Values are comma-separated origin lists, matching the
 *     `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` parse in `auth.definition.ts`
 *     (`trustedOrigins`): entries are trimmed and empty segments dropped.
 *   - A wildcard entry (one containing `*` or `?`) is compiled to a RegExp so
 *     the `cors` package matches it against the request Origin the same way
 *     better-auth's `trustedOrigins` does. This is what lets us trust the
 *     dj-site Cloudflare Pages preview deployments — every branch/commit gets
 *     a fresh `https://<hash>.wxyc-dj.pages.dev` host that can't be enumerated
 *     ahead of time, so we trust the whole subdomain with
 *     `https://*.wxyc-dj.pages.dev`. Without this the Express CORS layer would
 *     reject the preview origin even though better-auth's own `trustedOrigins`
 *     (which understands wildcards natively) trusts it, so credentialed
 *     browser calls to the auth service would still fail their preflight.
 *     `*` and `?` match within a single origin segment (they don't cross `/`),
 *     mirroring better-auth's `matchesOriginPattern` semantics. Literal entries
 *     are left as plain strings so exact-origin deploys are byte-for-byte
 *     unchanged.
 *   - Exactly one entry returns the bare pattern (string or RegExp), preserving
 *     the pre-BS#1107 header emission for single-origin deploys (the `cors`
 *     package sends the configured literal as ACAO on every response, or
 *     reflects the matched Origin for a single wildcard). Multiple entries
 *     return an array, which the `cors` package treats as a whitelist (ACAO is
 *     only emitted when the request's Origin matches an entry).
 *   - No usable value returns `false`, which disables the `cors` middleware —
 *     no `Access-Control-*` headers are ever emitted, so browsers refuse
 *     cross-origin reads while same-origin and non-browser clients (iOS app,
 *     supertest, curl) are unaffected. An error-level log makes the
 *     misconfigured deploy diagnosable; unlike `buildLoginPage` this does not
 *     throw, because taking the whole API down would also break the
 *     non-browser clients that never needed CORS.

 * not `https://evil.com` or a suffix like `…pages.dev.evil.com` (the `$`
