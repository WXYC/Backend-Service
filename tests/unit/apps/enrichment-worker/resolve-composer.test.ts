/**
 * Unit tests for `resolveComposer` (BS#1499 PR-3).
 *
 * `resolveComposer` is the sole site that maps an LML
 * `DiscogsMatchResult.writer_credits` block onto the BMI-ready
 * `composer` / `composer_source` pair written on the flowsheet row by
 * `finalizeRow`. It is pure (no DB), so this file takes no `pg` marker and
 * does no DB setup — mirroring `synthesize-search-urls-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * Contract pinned here:
 *   - `provenance: 'track'`   → `composer_source = 'discogs_track'`.
 *   - `provenance: 'release'` → `composer_source = 'discogs_release'`.
 *   - multiple names join with `'; '` (Discogs writer names can carry
 *     commas, e.g. "Last, First", so a comma delimiter would be ambiguous).
 *   - match but `writer_credits` undefined → artist-as-proxy fallback.
 *   - no-match (artwork null)             → artist-as-proxy fallback.
 *
 * The artist-proxy fallback dominating (~79% of plays per LML#699) is
 * expected, not a regression — it mirrors tubafrenzy's existing
 * auto-fill-BMI_COMPOSER-from-Artist default.
