/**
 * Clean-headliner extraction (BS#1604) + the clean-name LML gate (BS#1614)
 * + the billing-tail support capture that generalizes extraction into a
 * full billing parse (BS#1758).
 *
 * Extracted from map.ts so this module stays free of `@wxyc/database`
 * (whose client throws at import time without DB_* env vars) — the
 * BS#1614 name-set export script filters text dumps anywhere, without DB
 * credentials. map.ts re-exports `extractHeadliner`/`parseBilling`, so
 * ETL-side consumers are unchanged.
 *
 * triangle-shows' `artist` field is byte-identical to the event `name`
 * in practice — the full marquee/billing string, not a clean performer —
 * which starves the exact-match `concerts-artist-resolver` (9/259
 * distinct billings resolved). Until the upstream `headliner` field
 * (WXYC/triangle-shows#18) covers the corpus, derive a clean headliner
 * here. TRIANGLE_SHOWS-SPECIFIC by design: RHP headliners are already
 * clean, and the shared resolver stays untouched.
 *
 * Conservative by contract: prefer under-stripping — a billing left
 * dirty just stays unresolved (today's behavior), while over-stripping
 * can mangle a legitimate name into a WRONG resolution. `&`/`and` are
 * never treated as support delimiters (Andy Frasco & The U.N), and a
 * leading single mixed-case parenthetical word is kept ((Sandy) Alex
 * G) — only tag-shaped parentheticals strip. Idempotent: every rule
 * removes its own trigger, and the empty-result fallback returns a
 * string none of the rules re-fire on.
 *
 * `isCleanHeadliner` (BS#1614) sits beside the extractor ON PURPOSE: the
 * gate that decides which stored names are LML-eligible must evolve in
 * the same file as the extraction rules it composes with, so the two
 * can't drift apart (the constraint recorded on WXYC/Backend-Service#1614).
